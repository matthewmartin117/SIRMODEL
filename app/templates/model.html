<h2>Info</h2>
<p>Since the COVID-19 epidemic, researchers have predicted that there would be an increase in frequency of pandemics, due to several factors;
  such as the worlds ever increasing population density, enviromental travel, and rise of globalization. Experts in epidemiology have
  turned to modeling and simulations in order to understand these diseases and prepare for potential pandemics.
   SIR modeling is a simple yet powerful tool used in epidemiology to simulate the spread of infectious diseases
  within a population. It divides the population into three compartments: Susceptible (S), Infected (I), and Recovered (R).
   The model tracks how individuals move from being susceptible to infected, and eventually to recovered, often with immunity.
    By adjusting parameters such as the infection rate and recovery rate,
    the SIR model helps predict the dynamics of an outbreak, evaluate the impact of interventions,
     and understand the overall behavior of epidemics. Factors such number of interactions between healthy and ill people, recovery time,infection rate per contact, and recovery rate all
     can effect the epidemiology of a disease. This website was deisgned so users could see how different factors
    influence the spread of an epidemic.</p>

<div class="Variables">
  <h2>Understanding a simple SIR Model</h2>
  <p>The SIR model is used to simulate the spread of infectious diseases by dividing the population into three categories:</p>
  <ul>
      <li><strong>S (Susceptible):</strong> Individuals who are vulnerable to the infection but not yet infected.</li>
      <li><strong>I (Infected):</strong> Individuals who are currently infected and can spread the disease.</li>
      <li><strong>R (Recovered):</strong> Individuals who have recovered from the disease and are assumed to be immune.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The model uses two key parameters to calculate the dynamics of the disease:</p>
  <ul>
      <li><strong>a (Infection Rate):</strong> The rate at which susceptible individuals become infected after contact with an infected person.</li>
      <li><strong>b (Recovery Rate):</strong> The rate at which infected individuals recover. It is the inverse of the average duration of the infection.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The first model will visualize COVID-19 data using average infection rate and recovery rate from the year 2021-2022 when the epidemic was at its peak.</p>

    <h2>Experimenting with a more complex SIR Model</h2>
    <p>The SIR model can use additional factors that can improve the accuracy of the model.
      Infection rate and recovery rate can be used as a variable, as well as:  </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>T (Time): </strong>Length of time in days. Can help us examine the progression over a selected period of time. </li>
        <li><strong>rD (die from disease):</strong> Rate at which infected individuals who do not recover. Example: rD = 0.02 means 2% of those infected will die.</li>
        <li><strong>b (recovery rate):</strong> The length of days it takes for an individual to recover.Example: b = 7 days means those infected will recover after a week.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The model below allows you to experiment with these parameters and how they affect the rate of a hypothetical epidemic</p>
